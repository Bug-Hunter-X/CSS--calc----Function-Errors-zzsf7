The corrected CSS uses proper spacing around the operators within the `calc()` function to ensure that the calculation is correctly parsed by the browser.

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```
Adding spaces around the `-` operator makes the calculation unambiguous and ensures that the browser correctly evaluates `100%` minus `10px`.  Without the spaces, the browser may misinterpret the expression.
